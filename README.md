jQuery QUnit in .NET
====================

Runs QUnit tests inside .NET by using WatiN or HtmlUnit as a browser and NUnit or MSTest as a testing framework.

Based on [Joshua Flanagan's original work](http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/joshuaflanagan/archive/2008/09/18/running-jquery-qunit-tests-under-continuous-integration.aspx), but updated to work with the latest version of WatiN (2.0.5 at the time of writing) and QUnit.

There is also an extension to get the QUnit tests working in NUnit. It is easy to copy this extension and change it to work with your favourite unit testing framework.
